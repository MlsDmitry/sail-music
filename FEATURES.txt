**Authentication**


- [x] Log in functionality is provided by YaClientModel::requestAuth
method.

- [ ] Log out functionality is provided by YaClientModel::logOut ( don't
      forget to delete accessToken from configuration file)

- [ ] Write user-friendly interface which allows to log in/out.

User interface author's idea:

    * Log in button should be in the PullDownMenu in the main page.

    * Log out button should be in the PullDownMenu in Settings page
      only. I think if Log out will be displayed in dropdown in main
      page it may be misclicked, and log out will not be used oftenly
      that's why I think it should go to Settings page.

    * Display notification of (un)successful log in/out.

    * After successful log in replace it with settings button.
